First adventures in programming
Hey there! I'm a 29 year old father of 2 amazing kids and husband to a great wife. I'm wanting to learn programming to broaden my horizons and try new things. I love to learn and want to make sure I keep learning new things far into the future. I also want to ensure I am learning new skills that I can share with my children.
